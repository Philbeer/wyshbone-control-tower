# Wyshbone Tower – Task Plan (TOWER Series)

Tower is the orchestrator and overseer of the whole Wyshbone ecosystem.
It communicates with Supervisor, displays run results, and provides UI
tools for debugging, evaluation, and workflow triggering.

Each TOWER task should be implemented in its own feature branch.
