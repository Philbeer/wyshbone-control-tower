📋 COPY–PASTE PROMPT FOR TOWER (Evaluator Roadmap layer)
Paste everything below into Replit (Tower repl):

You are my coding assistant for the Wyshbone Tower repl.
 I want you to extend the existing “Critical Pathway Gen 2 V1 / Source Status / Wyshbone UI / Wyshbone Supervisor” planning view so that it also includes a dedicated Evaluator Roadmap column with five tasks: EVAL-001 to EVAL-005.
The goal is not to build the evaluator logic yet, but to give me a clear, clickable planning layer inside Tower that I can use to trigger future build prompts (like we did for the UI and Supervisor tasks).
Follow these rules:
Produce actual code, not instructions.


Use the existing Tower stack (TypeScript, React/Next or whatever is already there).


When modifying files, show the full updated file or clearly marked insertions.


No “TODO” placeholders – make everything runnable.


Keep UI minimal but consistent with the existing Critical Pathway dashboard.



1. Add a data model for Evaluator tasks
Create a small in-memory (or simple DB-backed) model for Evaluator tasks, similar to how you model the existing Critical Pathway tasks.
Each Evaluator task should have:
id: string (e.g. "EVAL-001")


title: string


status: "not_started" | "in_progress" | "done"


summary: string (one-line description)


detail: string (a fuller description)


Seed it with these five tasks:
EVAL-001 – Minimal Evaluator v0 (logging + investigations)


summary: “Add structured run logging and manual GPT-based investigations in Tower.”


detail: “Foundation layer: log UI/Supervisor runs with run IDs, create Investigations in Tower, bundle logs and context, send them to GPT, and store diagnosis + patch suggestions. No automated tests or detection yet.”


EVAL-002 – Automated behaviour tests


summary: “Define and run core conversational behaviour tests (golden paths).”


detail: “Add a small framework to define and run behaviour tests like greetings, personalisation via domain, basic lead search, and monitoring setup. Store results and show which tests pass/fail for each build.”


EVAL-003 – Automated detection (timeouts, errors, poor scores)


summary: “Detect failures and suspicious runs without human intervention.”


detail: “Watch logs for timeouts, repeated tool errors, plan failures, and low-quality scores. Automatically open Investigations when thresholds are hit, feeding them into the same GPT-based diagnosis pipeline.”


EVAL-004 – Patch quality + regression protection


summary: “Score patch suggestions and protect against regressions.”


detail: “After applying fixes, automatically re-run relevant behaviour tests and recent failing scenarios, score the patch impact, and flag regressions in Tower. Keep a history of patches and their test outcomes.”


EVAL-005 – Junior Developer Agent integration


summary: “Link Investigations and patches to an automated code-application flow.”


detail: “Integrate with Replit Agent or a Git workflow so patches from the Evaluator can be proposed as code changes. Still require human approval, but wire up the path from Investigation → suggested patch → applied change.”


Store these either in a simple config file (e.g. src/evaluator/evalTasks.ts) or in the same place you keep other Critical Pathway task definitions.

2. Extend the Critical Pathway / Roadmap view
Find the component that renders the current Tower planning view with sections like:
Critical Pathway Gen 2 V1


Source Status


Wyshbone UI


Wyshbone Supervisor


Extend this view to add a new column/section called:
Evaluator Roadmap
In that column, render the 5 Evaluator tasks as a simple list or cards, showing:
id (e.g. “EVAL-001”)


title


status


a truncated version of summary


Each task should be clickable.

3. Task detail panel / page
When I click an Evaluator task (e.g. EVAL-001):
Show a detail view (could be a right-hand panel, modal, or a separate route like /tower/evaluator/EVAL-001), which displays:


id


title


status


full summary


full detail


Also show a read-only text area or code block labelled:


 “Replit build pre-prompt (base)”


 For now, fill it with a simple base template like:

 You are my coding assistant for the Wyshbone Tower repl.
Implement {id}: {title}.
{detail}
Build on all previous EVAL tasks.
Produce actual code, not instructions.
 where {id}, {title}, and {detail} are interpolated from the task data.


This gives me something I can copy as a starting point when I later ask ChatGPT for a full build prompt for each specific EVAL task.

4. Status updates (optional but helpful)
Add a minimal way to toggle status for each Evaluator task between:
Not started


In progress


Done


This can be:
a small dropdown in the task detail view, or


buttons like “Start” / “Mark as done”.


Persist it however you already persist similar planning data (or use a simple in-memory store if that’s how the existing roadmap works).

5. Navigation
Add a simple way to access this view from wherever you currently access the Critical Pathway view:
If there is a sidebar or top-nav, ensure the existing menu item still works and the new Evaluator column appears alongside the other columns.


Do not remove or rename existing sections; only extend.



6. Keep styles consistent
Match the existing styling in Tower:
Same fonts, spacing, and card style as other roadmap panels.


No need for fancy design — just keep it neat and readable.



After you have implemented this, I should be able to:
Open the Tower Critical Pathway / roadmap view


See an Evaluator Roadmap column alongside the existing ones


Click any EVAL task to see its details and a base “Replit build pre-prompt” I can copy and refine later.
