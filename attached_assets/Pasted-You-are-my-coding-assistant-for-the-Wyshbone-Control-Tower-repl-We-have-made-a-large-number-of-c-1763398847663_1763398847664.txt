You are my coding assistant for the Wyshbone Control Tower repl.

We have made a large number of changes recently (conversation_run_id, unified runId ingestion, conversation grouping, conversation timelines, flagging, new routes, updated React components, etc.) and I need you to perform a **full structural audit**.

Before we do the audit, I need you to **collect and show me all key files** that define:
- database schema (schema.prisma or any equivalent)
- run ingestion logic
- run storage utilities (runStore, evaluator logic, meta storage)
- Tower API routes for runs, conversations, flags
- Any Zod/TS types for run logs
- Any server helpers that process request/response bodies
- React UI components related to: 
  - Recent Runs / Conversations cards
  - Manual Flags
  - Auto Flags
  - Investigate / Timeline views
  - Any shared components used by those views
- Any React pages or routes that load conversation data
- Any context/state providers used for run/conversation state
- Any new utility functions created during the conversation grouping implementation
- Any new documentation files created or modified (e.g. replit.md)

Your task:

1. Search the entire repository and list **all files** that match any of these categories.
2. Show the **full contents** of each file *one by one*, without skipping sections.
3. If any file is large, break it into multiple messages automatically.
4. Maintain ordering so I can follow the architecture clearly:
   A. Database schema  
   B. Server ingestion logic  
   C. runStore utilities  
   D. API routes  
   E. Types / Zod schemas  
   F. Shared server helpers  
   G. React components (cards, lists, timeline, flags)  
   H. React pages  
   I. Shared UI utilities  
   J. Documentation  

5. Do NOT rewrite or refactor anything yet.  
   This step is purely for **complete source visibility**.

6. After showing all files, produce a summary list confirming:
   - Total files found
   - Which architectural layers they belong to
   - Any potential duplicate logic, inconsistencies, or legacy files that need cleanup

7. Stop after summarizing.  
   Do not fix anything until I explicitly ask.

Start by scanning the repo and listing all matching files, then ask me to confirm before printing their full contents to avoid flooding me.
