You are my coding assistant for the Wyshbone Tower repl.

I want an in-app way to switch between the two Tower views WITHOUT manually changing the URL:

- The existing server-rendered `/status` page (Wyshbone Status Dashboard with Usage Meter + Critical Path + tasks list).
- The new React `/dashboard` page (Wyshbone Tower Evaluator Console with Recent Runs, Tower Status, and the Evaluator Console on the right).

Implement a simple, consistent top navigation that appears on BOTH views.

Requirements:

1. Two-tab header
   - Create a small header bar at the top with two tabs/links:
     - "Status & Plan" → `/status`
     - "Evaluator Console" → `/dashboard`
   - The active tab should be visually highlighted based on the current path:
     - When on `/status`, "Status & Plan" is active.
     - When on `/dashboard`, "Evaluator Console" is active.

2. Integration on `/status` (server-rendered page)
   - Locate the template / layout used to render the existing `/status` dashboard.
   - Add the nav header ABOVE the current content, without removing or rearranging the existing sections (Usage Meter, Critical Path, etc.).
   - Use the same font family and spacing conventions as the existing status page.
   - Keep styling minimal: a horizontal bar with two text buttons or pill-style tabs is fine.

3. Integration on `/dashboard` (React SPA)
   - Locate the root React component that renders the Evaluator Console dashboard (the page that currently shows "Wyshbone Tower", Tower Status, Recent Runs, and Evaluator Console).
   - Add the SAME nav header at the top of this layout, above the existing content.
   - Reuse the same markup / component if possible (e.g. a shared NavTabs component).
   - The active state must react correctly to the current location (use the router / window.location.pathname, whichever fits the existing setup).

4. Shared component (optional but preferred)
   - If it fits the codebase, create a small shared component like `TowerNavTabs` in the client (e.g. `client/src/components/TowerNavTabs.tsx`) that renders the two tabs and determines the active one.
   - On the server-rendered `/status` page, you can either:
     - Render the same HTML structure directly, or
     - Inject a minimal pre-rendered version of the same tabs.
   - The important thing is that visually they look the same and link to the same URLs.

5. Styling
   - Keep styles consistent with the existing Tower styling:
     - Use existing CSS / tailwind / utility classes already used in the project.
     - Make the active tab slightly bolder or underlined, or use a subtle background.
   - Do NOT radically redesign the page; just add a simple, neat switcher.

6. Behaviour
   - Clicking "Status & Plan" should navigate to `/status`.
   - Clicking "Evaluator Console" should navigate to `/dashboard`.
   - No full-page reload hacks; use normal navigation compatible with the current server + React setup.

7. Deliverables
   - Produce actual code changes only: full contents for any new files and precise edits for existing files (with file paths).
   - Do not describe what you are going to do; just show the code needed to implement it.

After implementing, please make sure both URLs still work:

- `/status` still shows the original Usage Meter + Critical Path + tasks.
- `/dashboard` still shows the Evaluator Console, now with the nav at the top.

The only functional change should be the ability to click between the two views via the new header tabs.
