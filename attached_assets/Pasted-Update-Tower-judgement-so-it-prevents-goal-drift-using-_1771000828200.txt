Update Tower judgement so it prevents goal drift using hard vs soft constraints from the plan/artefact payload.

Inputs available in artefact payload:

original_user_goal

normalized_goal

hard_constraints: string[]

soft_constraints: string[]

requested_count and delivered_count (or derivable)

constraint fields like location, prefix_filter, business_type, etc.

Rules:

Tower must judge success against:

requested_count (hard)

business_type match (hard)

and any constraints listed in hard_constraints

Tower may recommend relaxing only soft constraints.

Tower must never suggest a change that relaxes or drops a hard constraint.

Suggested changes must remain structured objects:
{ type, field, from, to, reason }

For CHANGE_PLAN on insufficient results:

Prefer expanding or modifying a soft constraint first (example order):
a) EXPAND_AREA(location)
b) BROADEN_QUERY(business_type) ONLY if business_type is soft (normally hard so this is usually disallowed)
c) RELAX_CONSTRAINT(prefix_filter) ONLY if prefix_filter is soft

If the only way to succeed would require relaxing a hard constraint:

Return verdict: ASK_USER

Include rationale explaining the tradeoff and present 2 options:
Option A: relax location
Option B: relax prefix_filter

suggested_changes should be empty in ASK_USER.

Keep existing STOP / ACCEPT behaviours unchanged.

Acceptance test:

For “Find 5 pubs in Arundel that begin with P” with hard=[count,business_type], soft=[location,prefix]:

If Arundel has 0 matches for prefix P:

Tower should not ACCEPT a plan that drops prefix and returns 20 pubs, unless prefix was soft AND the plan clearly reports “prefix relaxed”.

Preferred: CHANGE_PLAN suggests EXPAND_AREA(location) while keeping prefix, so the agent searches nearby but still for names starting with P.

If after max replans there are still 0 matches and relaxing hard constraints is required:

Tower returns ASK_USER (not CHANGE_PLAN).

Do not add any natural language suggestion parsing. No strings. Contract must remain strict.
