You are updating the Wyshbone Tower codebase. 

Goal: Build “Tower Dev Chat v0” – a simple internal developer chat interface that:
1. Allows me to describe an issue and upload a screenshot.
2. Tower stores the issue in a new database table.
3. Tower automatically gathers context for the issue:
   - Finds relevant source files in the repo using string search.
   - Fetches the last 50 backend log lines that contain related error messages.
4. Tower displays the issue + context inside a new UI page in Tower.

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT implement any patch generation or GitHub commits.
This version ONLY:
- captures issue descriptions/screenshots
- stores them
- finds relevant files
- grabs logs
- displays them

### PHASE 1 – Database + API
Create new tables in Supabase/Drizzle:

Table: dev_issues
- id (uuid, pk)
- title (text)
- description (text)
- screenshot_url (text)
- created_at (timestamp)
- status (text, default "new")

Table: dev_issue_context
- id (uuid, pk)
- issue_id (uuid, fk → dev_issues.id)
- file_path (text)
- file_contents (text)
- log_excerpt (text)
- created_at (timestamp)

Create API endpoints under /api/dev/issues:
POST /create   – create issue
POST /context  – given issue_id, run search+log gathering and store results
GET /:id       – get issue + context
GET /          – list issues

### PHASE 2 – Context Gathering Logic
Implement a backend service that:
- Takes the issue description and screenshot filename
- Extracts search keywords:
  - UI labels (e.g., “Add Customer”, “Failed to create customer”)
  - Error messages
- Searches repo for matching files:
  - Search in /app, /src, /components, /pages, /lib, /api
  - For each match → store file path + contents in dev_issue_context
- Fetch recent logs:
  - For now, use the Tower server logs (tail last ~200 lines)
  - Filter for keywords
  - Store in dev_issue_context.log_excerpt

### PHASE 3 – Tower UI Page
Create a new page in Tower UI:
Path: /dev/issues

This page must:
- Show a form with:
  - Title
  - Description textarea
  - Screenshot upload
  - Button: “Create Issue”
- After submission:
  - Call /api/dev/issues/create
  - Then call /api/dev/issues/context with returned issue_id
  - Show a spinner while gathering context
  - Show a final panel:
     - Issue details
     - Screenshot preview
     - List of relevant files (click to expand contents)
     - Log excerpts

Also add a sidebar link:
“Developer Issues”

### RULES:
- Work incrementally.
- After each phase, report what files were created/modified.
- DO NOT vibing-expand the scope.
- Do not build patch/auto-fix code.
- Do not refactor unrelated files.
- Keep everything minimal and clean.

When finished with Phase 3, STOP and wait for my confirmation.
