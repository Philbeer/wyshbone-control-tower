You are working in the Wyshbone Tower codebase.

Goal: update Tower to judge Lead-Finder runs using CVL artefacts/evidence, not trusted upstream counts.

You have a known baseline:

LOCATION currently always passes (no-op) → must be fixed to use CVL results

delivered_matching_accumulated is currently trusted blindly → must not be used when CVL is present

Constraints (non-negotiable)

Do NOT add new tools.

Do NOT require full semantic goal verification in Phase 1.

Keep judgement logic minimal: use CVL’s verification_summary as the source of truth.

Implement
1) Add CVL-aware input shape

Extend TowerVerdictInput to accept CVL payloads (or references):

constraints_extracted (requested_count_user, constraints[])

verification_summary (verified_exact_count, constraint_results[])

If Tower is invoked with a single composite input, accept these fields inside success_criteria or meta if that’s how it’s currently wired — but treat them as first-class once present.

2) Change the count gate to prefer verified counts

Current deliveredCount resolution chain must change:

If verification_summary.verified_exact_count exists, use it as deliveredCount.

Only fall back to old deliveredCount heuristics if CVL is not present.

This specifically prevents ACCEPT based on delivered_matching_accumulated.

3) Replace LOCATION no-op with CVL status

For LOCATION constraints:

Do not auto-pass.

If CVL provides status yes/no/unknown for the location constraint, use it.

If CVL absent, retain legacy behaviour but mark in rationale “location not verifiable” (do not silently pass as “true”).

4) Enforce hard-constraint evidence rule (Phase 1)

PASS/ACCEPT only if:

verified_exact_count >= requested_count_user

all hard constraints have status yes (from verification_summary)

If any hard constraint is unknown:

CHANGE_PLAN if replans remain AND progress plausible

STOP if the unknown is due to “unverifiable with current tools” (Supervisor should pass reason; Tower should preserve it)

If any hard constraint is no:

CHANGE_PLAN if replans remain and there is an actionable suggestion

otherwise STOP with explicit constraint_id

5) Suggestions (keep narrow)

Only emit these suggestions in Phase 1:

EXPAND_AREA

ADD_VERIFICATION_STEP

RELAX_CONSTRAINT

Do not invent new suggestion types.

6) Tests

Add/adjust tests that prove:

Tower does NOT accept when delivered_matching_accumulated is high but verified_exact_count is low

LOCATION no longer auto-passes when CVL says unknown/no

ACCEPT requires all hard constraints = yes

Non-goals (do not touch)

Do not redesign leadQuality scoring

Do not implement goal semantic checks

Do not refactor unrelated judgement branches

Deliverable: Tower judgement becomes evidence-based when CVL artefacts are present, while preserving legacy behaviour when CVL is absent.
