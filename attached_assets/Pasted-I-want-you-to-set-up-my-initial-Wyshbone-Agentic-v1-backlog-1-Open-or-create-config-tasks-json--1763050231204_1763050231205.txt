I want you to set up my initial Wyshbone Agentic v1 backlog.

1. Open or create config/tasks.json in this repl.
2. Replace its entire contents with the EXACT JSON array below (no comments, no trailing commas):

Store this goal in persistent session state (e.g. per-user context) and make it available to the tool-calling layer so tools like lead search and monitoring can see it. Do not hardcode any specific industries; treat it as free text. After implementation, expose a helper function like `getUserGoal(sessionId)` we can call from elsewhere.",

Once clarified, proceed to call tools with the enriched parameters.",

3. Make sure config/tasks.json is valid JSON (no trailing comma at the end).
4. Restart the server if needed so /status and /tasks.json pick up the new tasks.
5. Confirm to me that:
   - /status shows these tasks under the appropriate app cards, and
   - /tasks.json returns them grouped by app as designed earlier.
