Context:
This Replit app is the Wyshbone Control Tower service.
It is being migrated back into Replit as a standalone app.

Architecture context (important):
- Wyshbone consists of separate services: UI, Supervisor, and Control Tower.
- UI and Supervisor are already running in Replit.
- This app (Control Tower) is NOT user-facing; it is an internal orchestration/evaluation service.
- Control Tower will be called by Supervisor via API, not directly by the UI.

Branch / source of truth:
- The repository default branch (main) has just been updated by merging the feature branch
  `tow-8-vertical-id-logging`.
- main is now the correct, deployable version of Control Tower.
- Do NOT check out or switch branches.

Critical constraints:
- Do NOT create a new Supabase project.
- Do NOT change databases.
- Supabase is the single source of data.
- Backend-only Supabase access is used (service role / DATABASE_URL).
- No frontend anon keys, no VITE keys.

What we are trying to achieve:
- Get Control Tower running cleanly in Replit.
- Confirm it binds to the correct PORT and HOST.
- Confirm it can connect to the existing Supabase database.
- Do NOT run migrations unless explicitly told to.
- Do NOT refactor logic or change architecture.

Your tasks (in order):
1) Install dependencies and start the server using the existing run/start command.
2) Print which environment variables are present (NAMES ONLY, no secrets):
   - SUPABASE_URL
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   - DATABASE_URL
   - PORT
   - HOST
   - NODE_ENV
3) Confirm which database connection path the app is using
   (DATABASE_URL vs Supabase client).
4) Verify basic health:
   - Server starts
   - Listens on the assigned Replit PORT
   - No crash loops
5) Ensure CORS is NOT overly permissive.
   - Only allow known internal services / localhost / Replit dev origin if needed.
6) Output a short runbook:
   - How this service is started
   - What env vars it requires
   - Which endpoint can be used as a health check

Do NOT:
- create tables
- run migrations
- introduce anon auth
- widen CORS to '*'
- restructure files

If anything looks wrong, STOP and report instead of “fixing”.
