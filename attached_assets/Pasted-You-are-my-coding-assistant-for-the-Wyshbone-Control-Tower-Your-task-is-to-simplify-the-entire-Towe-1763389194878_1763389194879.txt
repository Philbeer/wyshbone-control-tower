You are my coding assistant for the Wyshbone Control Tower.
Your task is to simplify the entire Tower dashboard and investigation workflow so it is easy for a human to use.
Implement the following changes exactly as described.

1. Replace the existing section names with these THREE sections only
(A) Recent Runs

Shows ALL user chats from Wyshbone UI.
Each run must include:

Input

Output

Time

Status

Button: “Flag this run”

Button: “Investigate & Fix”

Remove all other metadata unless needed internally.

(B) Auto-Flagged Runs

These are runs Tower automatically identifies as having issues.
Rename the section to:

“Auto-Flagged Runs (Automatically Detected Issues)”

Each entry must include:

The original input

The reason it was flagged (short sentence)

Button: “Investigate & Fix”

Tower should auto-flag issues such as:
• bad reasoning
• hallucination
• contradicting earlier chat
• unhelpful tone
• failure to follow user request

(C) Manually-Flagged Runs

Rename the section to:

“Manual Flags (Runs You Marked as Needing Fix)”

Every run flagged by a human (from Recent Runs) goes here.
Each entry must include:

The original input

The reason the user selected (optional)

Button: “Investigate & Fix”

2. Add a “Flag this Run” button to Recent Runs

When clicked:

Create a new Manual Investigation entry

Store:

runId

input

output

timestamp

userId

optional “reason” field

Add the entry to the Manual Flags section

No need to open the right-hand console.

3. Implement a simple “Investigate & Fix” workflow

When clicked (from any section):

Open a clean investigation page

Show:

Run input

Run output

Auto diagnosis (brief)

Tower must:

Determine what was wrong

Suggest a patch (one or more file edits)

Display:
“Approve Patch” and “Reject Patch”

When the user clicks Approve
→ send structured patch suggestions to Replit via existing API.
When the user clicks Reject
→ ask the user what was wrong with the patch.

This replaces the Evaluator sidebar for user-flow purposes.

4. Remove or collapse unused sections

Collapse these by default under a heading called “Advanced Tools”:

Tower Status

Behaviour Tests

All Runs

Evaluator Console

These should be hidden unless intentionally expanded.

5. Remove confusing language

Replace all references to:

“conversation quality”

“manual investigation”

“auto conversation quality”

“patch lifecycle”

“junior developer agent”

“EVAL-005/006/…”

“sandbox evaluation”

With the simpler terms:

“Auto-Flagged Runs”

“Manual Flags”

“Investigate & Fix”

“Patch Suggestion”

6. Keep only the essentials visible

Default visible (expanded):

Recent Runs

Auto-Flagged Runs

Manual Flags

Everything else should be hidden behind one collapsible section.

7. Reset the dashboard data (optional)

Include a button in the Advanced Tools section:

“Clear all flags and investigations (Reset Tower)”

This should clear:

Auto-flagged items

Manual-flagged items

Past investigations

Patch attempts

But must NOT delete recent runs or system schema.

8. Ensure the right-hand sidebar only shows live investigations

The Evaluator sidebar should only appear when a user clicks Investigate & Fix.

It must NOT appear during normal use or when selecting Recent Runs.

🔧 Implementation Notes (for Replit)

Modify dashboard UI templates

Add two new endpoints:

POST /tower/runs/:id/flag

POST /tower/investigate/:id

Add logic to insert flagged runs into the correct lists

Ensure all patch API output remains unchanged

No changes to database schema unless needed

Keep the system behaviour identical, only change presentation + UX
