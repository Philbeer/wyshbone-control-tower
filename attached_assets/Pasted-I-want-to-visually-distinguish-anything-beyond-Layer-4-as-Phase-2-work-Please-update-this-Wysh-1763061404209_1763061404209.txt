I want to visually distinguish anything beyond Layer 4 as “Phase 2” work.

Please update this WyshbonePoller repl so that:

GOAL
- Any task with layer >= 5 is clearly marked as **Phase 2** in the UI.
- The label should appear in bold next to the layer name or task title anywhere tasks are rendered.

DETAILS

1. DETECTION
   - Use the existing `layer` field on tasks (1–6).
   - A task is considered Phase 2 if: task.layer >= 5.

2. BADGE / LABEL
   - In the HTML rendering for tasks (Critical Path section, Source Status cards, and any other task lists):
     - For each Phase 2 task, add a bold text label:
       - e.g. **Phase 2** or `<strong>Phase 2</strong>`
     - Place it near the layer/group label or next to the task title so it’s clearly visible.
   - For example:
       Layer 5 – SELF-IMPROVEMENT & EXPERIMENTATION **(Phase 2)**
     or:
       [M][PLANNED] POL-040 – Define Experiment object **Phase 2**

   - The exact styling can be simple:
       - Use `<strong>` for bold.
       - Optionally wrap it in a small span with a subtle style (e.g. smaller font-size, slight padding) but keep it minimal.

3. WHERE TO SHOW IT
   - Apply the Phase 2 label anywhere tasks are rendered:
     - In the per-app “Source Status” task lists.
     - In any task grouping sections that include Layer >= 5 (e.g. Poller tasks, future roadmap, etc.).
   - It is OK if the Critical Path section never shows Phase 2 tasks (since it’s for Layers 1–4), but the code should still be robust: if a Phase 2 task somehow appears there, it should still show the label.

4. IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
   - You do NOT need to change tasks.json or the task objects themselves; just use `task.layer` at render time to decide whether to show the label.
   - Keep the rest of the layout as it is now; we’re only adding a visual tag, not changing grouping or filtering.

5. VALIDATION
   - After changes:
     - /status loads correctly.
     - Any task with layer >= 5 shows a bold “Phase 2” indication next to its layer or title.
     - Tasks with layers 1–4 remain unchanged.
