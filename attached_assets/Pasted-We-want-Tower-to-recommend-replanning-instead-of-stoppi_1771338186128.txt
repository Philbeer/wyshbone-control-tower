We want Tower to recommend replanning instead of stopping in the common leadgen case:

Policy change required
When judging a leads_list artefact:

If delivered < requested

And replans are available (canReplan(input) true)

And location is a soft constraint (i.e., expanding radius is allowed)

Then Tower must return:

verdict: fail

action: change_plan

with a suggestion: EXPAND_AREA (e.g., radius_km doubles up to a cap)
Instead of returning action: stop with gap no_further_progress_possible.

Current problem
In production, Tower often returns stop because:

constraints are missing/empty OR legacy constraints are not passed through on judge-artefact route,

which yields no suggestions,

then Tower falls through to STOP.

We already have a Supervisor override working (stop→change_plan), but we want Tower to do it correctly so Supervisor doesn’t need to override.

Deliverables

Implement the policy change in the leads_list verdict path so that:

shortfall + canReplan + soft location ⇒ CHANGE_PLAN with EXPAND_AREA

even if constraint parsing fails or suggestions are empty, as long as we can safely expand area

Ensure we still STOP when:

replans exhausted

location is hard (not expandable)

or we’ve already expanded to max radius cap (e.g. 50km) and still no progress

Ensure the output includes:

metrics.gaps includes insufficient_count

and a clear reason like “expanding area because location is soft and replans remain”

constraint_results should be populated when possible, but must not block the suggestion

Add/extend tests:

Case A: constraints typed and include soft location → expect CHANGE_PLAN + EXPAND_AREA

Case B: constraints missing/empty but successCriteria indicates location is soft (or location can be inferred) → still expect CHANGE_PLAN + EXPAND_AREA

Case C: replans exhausted → STOP

Case D: location hard → STOP

Provide:

file/line references

test output proving green

Notes / Guidance

Keep the judgement contract (ACCEPT | CHANGE_PLAN | STOP).

Make the behaviour deterministic and explainable.

Don’t rely on Supervisor overrides. Tower should be the authority on replan vs stop.
