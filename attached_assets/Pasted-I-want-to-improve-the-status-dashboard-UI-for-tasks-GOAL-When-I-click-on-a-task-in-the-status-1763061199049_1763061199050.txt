I want to improve the /status dashboard UI for tasks.

GOAL
When I click on a task in the /status page, I should see a pop-up (modal or side drawer) that shows the full task detail, including the `replitPrompt`, with a one-click “Copy prompt” button that copies that text to the clipboard. This is so I can easily paste the prompt into the Wyshbone UI or Wyshbone Supervisor repl agents.

Please implement the following:

1. DATA ACCESS
   - Use the existing task data you already have in memory (from config/tasks.json).
   - Each rendered task row should have access to:
     - id
     - title
     - description
     - app
     - layer
     - status
     - complexity
     - criticalPath
     - replitPrompt

2. CLICKABLE TASK ROWS
   - In the HTML for each task row (both in the Critical Path section and under each Source Status card), wrap the row in a clickable element (e.g. <button> or <div> with a data-task-id attribute).
   - When a row is clicked, prevent navigation and instead open a task detail panel.

3. TASK DETAIL POP-UP
   - Add a lightweight modal or side drawer to the page (no external CSS frameworks, just simple CSS).
   - The pop-up should show:
     - Task ID and title
     - App (UI / SUP / POL / etc.)
     - Layer and group name
     - Status and complexity
     - Full description
     - A readonly <textarea> or <pre> block containing the `replitPrompt` text (even if it is empty for placeholder tasks).

   - For placeholder tasks where `replitPrompt` is an empty string, show a short message like:
     - “No implementation prompt yet – this is a roadmap placeholder.”

4. COPY-TO-CLIPBOARD BUTTON
   - Inside the modal, add a “Copy prompt” button.
   - When clicked:
     - If `replitPrompt` is non-empty, copy it to the clipboard using `navigator.clipboard.writeText(replitPrompt)`.
     - Show a small confirmation message, e.g. “Copied!” for a couple seconds.
     - If `replitPrompt` is empty, show a message like “No prompt available for this task.”

   - Keep the implementation simple vanilla JS; you can inline the script in the HTML template if needed.

5. UX DETAILS
   - Modal should have:
     - A close button (X) in the top-right.
     - Clicking outside the modal (on the overlay) should also close it.
     - The page should not reload when opening/closing the modal.
   - Limit the height of the prompt area and allow vertical scrolling inside it so long prompts don’t blow up the layout.

6. WIRING
   - Make sure that:
     - Critical Path section uses the same click behavior.
     - The per-app task lists under “Source Status” also use the same modal.
   - You can embed the full task list as a JS object in the rendered HTML to avoid extra network calls; or, if you prefer, expose an internal endpoint like /task/:id.json and fetch dynamically. Either approach is fine.

7. VALIDATION
   - After implementation, ensure:
     - /status loads without errors.
     - Clicking on a task opens the detail modal with all the expected fields.
     - “Copy prompt” successfully copies the `replitPrompt` field for tasks like UI-001, UI-002, SUP-001, SUP-002, etc.
